  <p>There are different processes for classification for different disability groups. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230929162149/https://youtu.be/SsMSgSS7D1Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch this video</a> to find out how physical classifications are carried out.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Classification provides a structure for competition. Athletes competing in Paralympic sports have an impairment that leads to a competitive disadvantage in sport.  Consequently, a system has to be put in place to minimise the impact of impairments on sport performance and to ensure the success of an athlete is determined by skill, fitness, power, endurance, tactical ability and mental focus. This system is called classification.</p>
